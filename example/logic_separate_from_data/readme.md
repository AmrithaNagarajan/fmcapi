# Build Docker Image
The "Docker Image" folder contains the necessary information to build
a Docker image.  Just run the ```build_docker_image.sh``` file.

# Build Docker Container
Use the ```build_docker_container.sh``` file to build and run the container.
The syntax of the docker run command is commented in that BASH file.
